We applied this strategy to study the disease Fanconi Anemia (FA). Based on 20 genes that are known to be related to FA, we identified an additional 97 genes that are functionally related and organized these genes into a hierarchy of 25 cellular components and processes. This hierarchy and the genes can be found on the NDEx database: http://ndexbio.org/#/newNetwork/ab9bb6de-081a-11e7-aba2-0ac135e8bacf
